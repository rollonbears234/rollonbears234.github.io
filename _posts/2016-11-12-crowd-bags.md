<h3> Why start my first post on backpacks?</h3>

<p>I think there are a few items that make life better everyday. Having a great pack comes first because we need something to hold everything. I love having a pack that I can just grab and go and know I can handle anything throught my day.</p>

<p>In general, I am very careful with my money, but I rationalize spending more for things that really matter and would rather have less things but my thngs be better quality. The things I will be using everyday are worth higher quality beause spreading out the cost/usage, spending more just makes sense.</p>

<h3>Factors</h3>

<p>Criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Style</li>
  <li>Easily handle water bottles</li>
  <li>Lots of pockets and organization</li>
  <li>Minimal effort to access what you need</li>
  <li>Unique</li>
  <li>High quality materials</li>
</ol>

<p>Different Uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everyday bag, more general</li>
  <li>Photography</li>
  <li>Travel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Past Bags</h3>
<p>I started out with finding Timbuk2 in high school. I first tried the basic messenger and then another random bag from them that was on sale.</p>

<p>Then I tried the Osprey Pixel. This bag met a lot of my expectations, such as pockets and organization, but contained the following flaws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No outside water bottle pocket, this is a huge red flag because carrying around a water bottle on the inside of a bag takes up a lot of space and can spill, not to mention it is hard to access.</li>
  <li>Side access laptop access, if you forget to close this, the laptop falls right out. I dented my MacBook air because of this</li>
</ul>

<p>I now have ordered the Everyday BackPack from Indiegogo 30L because I wasnâ€™t satisfied with the Pixel.</p>

<h3>The Options</h3>
<p>I want to just jot down a bunch of the bags I have considered and thought cool. From there I will identify more prominent bags that stick out among bags that are already good.</p>

<p>I think it is best to get volume so that if nothing I pick is quite the best, you still have many more options to explore</p>

#### Winner: 
As much as I want to, I haven't bought all the bags in the above list, but the Every Day Backpack from Peak Design is amazing. I have the 30L and have really enjoyed it for Traveling. I used it for a month long trip through Guatamalma, El Salvador, and Honduras, as we as on a week trip to Taiwan. I have seen the 20L and I would prefer that size for actual everyday use, the 30L is too big to use regularily, especially since I am normally minimal and don't need a lot of gear.
