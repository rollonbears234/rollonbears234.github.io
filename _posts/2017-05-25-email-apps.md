## There are so many e-mail apps!
This post aims to present most of the options out there are some not as known options. I get really excited about new e-mail apps because I think e-mail is such a powerful tool still with a lot of room to grow. We are seing AI assistants being added to e-mail as well as more features and integrations added such as detecting flights, snoozing, and tracking. I will first present all the options I have found and then write a little bit about the best ones.


#### The Apps:

| App Name        | Notes on App | Platform Tested On  | Value-Added  | Miscellaneous |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| :-------------:| -----:|
| Airmail | I beta test their new releases through hocekey app. I've enjoyed the app and its many features will make power users happy  | IOS/MAC | Tons of settings and integrations with services like Trello | Wouldn't pay for yet, just because there are lots of good free options out there. |
| Alto      | Email by AOL. Of course they have snooze too. They also sort emails for you like shopping, finance, travel, social. Good UI| IOS |They have little applets, they show you flights they find, Tracking from any receipt they find. Really cool | Fun app to use, I just think it has a lot of competition with spark and Email |
| Apple Mail      | It's Apple's app, enough said. | Apple only | No added value, this app is super standard and behind the curve on a lot of the features. | I only use this on IOS because to send an e-mail frmo a 3-rd party app, you need the mail app isntalled. |
| Astro | Newer app By EasyDo, this app will surprise you, it is suprisingyl good. | IOS | Just a really clean email app with some extra features like snooze. Use this if you want something basic.  | Where is the MAC app! |
| Gmail      | Great for Gmail accounts, still limited functionality, but this is a great gmail.com experience. I use that a lot for school so it works.       |   All | right-aligned | Needs support for other types of emails. Google inbox is also pretty cook |
| Handle | Email with Todo and calendar built in      |    IOS | Combining everything I use to keep track of my day into one app.  | The idea is great, but the execution isn't there to interact with all my todo and email services. |
| Inky Mail      | Great for Gmail accounts, still limited functionality, but this is a great gmail.com experience. I use that a lot for school so it works.  | IOS and MAC |Encryption! | Nice, but is a premium service |
|  Inbox     | Google's next vision of e-mail  | All | Nice for tracking packages and still keeping Google's great search | Many people don't like the look, it can be fun to use, but I always end up going back to normal gmail.com |
| Mailtime | Smart inbox, integrated contacts, Emails are in bubbles much like swing mail , use an @ sign to “call attention to things”. Force touch works.       | IOS | Giphy and dropbox support | Much nicer of an app, way better than Swingmail. Great contacts, easy to see information about sender and receiver. The messaging feature worked pleasantly well.  |
| Morning Mail      | Would be good but needs more features other than its swiping, and an extra inbox costs $.99, no one wants to pay for that |IOS |Really cool unread section for swiping through emails with a breeze. Can easily go back to archives.  | Nice, but only practical for reading e-mail, not actually using e-mail. |
| Outlook      | Microsofts replacement of Acompli, everyone's favorite e-mail client. | Web and IOS |They recently added in integrations, but only for microsoft accounts.  | Nice calendar integration (they shut down sunrise) and file integration. Good app for business use.  |
| Polymail      | Very nice looking e-mail app, wowed the world on product hunt when first announced.  |  IOS and Mac | Really clean. This app looks beautiful. Has features packed into a nice package. | I only stopped using it because I found it to be buggy. |
| Spark | Readdle makes some great apps, this is no expection.      |  IOS and Mac | They are planning on adding more services into their apps soon. They have a super clean app with a nice focused view.  | ... |
| Swingmail | Trying to make email into a messaging app (even with a keypad)       |    IOS| Siri access (might be cool). Lots of emails allowed, many I haven’t heard of (International) Algorithm to find and filter important emails. Works with force touch!  | Mail in a smart inbox (like Spark) and chat view! Also contact merging. I didn't like this interaction much, but it might work better for some people.  |
| Trove | I love their AI archive. In one swipe I can archive all the stuff I normally get rid of. Really unique feature.       |   IOS | Lacks good calendar support in the app, however the swipe to archive feature is really nice as well as the enriched information about contacts. | They said they are coming out with a desktop app too! I can't wait for that.  |
| Unibox | $4.99 for pro for multiple email accounts. Syncs with gravatar.com to get pictures of people and avatars. has an inbox zero setting        |   IOS | It looks nice | ... |
| unroll.me | Super good for controlling your inbox.       |IOS and Mac | I love the roll up feature | *They were caught selling data :(* |

#### Top Choices

##### Airmail

Using this app makes e-mail easier. They have many options for sorting e-mails such as snooze and ToDo or as a Memo. Instead of just saving e-mails in one long list, it helps you organize them into things you have to do or just e-mails that are there for information. I also like the touchbar support and that you can edit e-mails with HTML or Markdown.

##### Trove (previously called Notion)

I love the quick swipe feature for this app. I use e-mail on my phone to quickly read through e-mails and organize them so that when I get back to my desktop, I have it organized and ready for me to attent to what is important. This app trains the ML model based on what I mark as archive-able and not. It remembers what I select and automatically marks e-mails as potential junk. When I am ready, it just swipes them all away. I know spam filters already use ML, but I don't want to not see these e-mails, I want to just be able to archive them in one batch if I recognize them all as junk. It makes me feel in control of my e-mail.

#### Parting notes:

I make no claims that these are the best e-mail apps, in fact they probably aren't. Trove isn't the best at searching or file integration and since I am using the Beta version of Airmail, it constantly asks me to upgrade. Spark and Outlook are probably better e-mail apps, but I have enjoyed using Airmail and Trove enough to keep them on my phone and mac for all of 2017 so far and that is saying something since I switch apps a lot. Give them a try, it might work for you and might not, depending on how you like using e-mail.
