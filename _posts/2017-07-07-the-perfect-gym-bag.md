### Gym Bags

Since finishing up school, I no longer have the ability to just walk to the gym in my gym clothes, going to the gym in a part of my daily planning and I have to bring all my gym clothes with me. With that comes the need to find a great gym bad. I considered a work bad that also doubles as a gym bag, this way I wouldn't need multiple bags. However, I also like the idea of bringing a sepeate bag just for the gym, this way I can just take my gym bag with me when it is time to work out instead of all my stuff. Having a seperate bag for the gym also makes packing easier because you have more space, flexibility, and a bag for dirty clothes. 

Note: I used to use the [Bomber Barrel](http://www.bomberco.com/shop-paracord-survival-gear/bomber-barrel-duffle-bag-set) bag, but it broke.

### My Pick

I found a great deal on the old navy bag since it was the fourth of July for only $20. I ended up cancelling my order becauase [Bomber Barrel](http://www.bomberco.com/shop-paracord-survival-gear/bomber-barrel-duffle-bag-set) got back to me and told me they would replace my current broken bag. Lucky me!
