I don't like the idea of bringing a pen and paper to the gym with me, and I am tired of going to the gym and not really knowing what I want to work on that day. Our health is one of the few things that is super easy to quantify, it just takes some setting up to get you on the right path. I am writting this as my quest to find the best fitness tracker for keeping track of workouts. 

### Criteria and Testing

I am testing a lot of apps, but I am giving them each a try during each workout. I am only testing apps that are free or possibly a free trial or an upgrade to a pro account. as well as apps that have an IOS version. Having an apple watch app is going to factor heavily into my decision, I want to reduce as much of the process of logging my sets and reps as possible. After each workout I will write down some things that were great and some things not to great, then I'll pick my favorite and potentially upgrade to a pro account with more features.

I am testing Apple Watch apps when available, but during testing, I have found that it is a nice bonus but not a necessity, I always have my phone on my with music playing to bluetooth headphones. 


## The Apps:

#### [Fitbod Workout Log](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitbod/id1041517543?ls=1&mt=8): Strength Lifting Bodybuilding

Overall, this all is very pleasant to use and has some very unique featuers that make the app much better than just regular loging. The logging interface isn't as easy to use as some other apps on the list, but I did like how easy the workouts were to start. It is also missing some key features like timing rest between sets. 

Features:
* Create a workout based on your previous workouts to help with recovery
* Auto generates workouts based on target muscle groups
* Pick a couple exercies and the app Fitbod automatically creates a workout
* Instructional video for built in exercises
* Nice workout overview including digagram of muscles used. 
* Keep track of muscles recovering so you have proper rest 

#### [Stacked](http://getstackedapp.com): 

Overall it has a lot of good features. I liked the how you can set the weight you are doing by saying what weights you have on the ends of your barbell. The app overall though is very cluttered. There is text everywhere and it's overwhelming to look at. 

#### [JeFit](https://www.jefit.com): 
This app is a beast. There is a lot to cover here, but it can be broked down into three types of users. Free, Pro, and Elite (subscription). I would consider the pro, but it still seems limiting. They say it gives "more custom exercise storage" as well as "more __", but that isn't unlimited storage.  

Features:
* Progress pics
* lots of workout stats
* "on the fly mode" for improvising workouts
* easy workout planning + supersets are super easy to create
* automatic rest counter
* 1RM calculator built into the workout flow - a plus since a lot off apps keep them seperate
* apple watch app

Overall, a great looking app that is easy to use. Even the free version is nice, but the ads are ugly. 


#### [GymBook](https://www.gymbookapp.com):

Lots of complaints here. There is no clear workout start, its all based on workouts that have exercises in them and you can enter them and record a set as you please. I didn't like this because its hard to feel like its a routine. Also, creating exercises is cumbersome and there is no next button in workouts so they require a lot of clicking around. 


#### [Gymatic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gymatic-workout-tracker-exercise-routines-gym-log/id1036069872?mt=8)

This app is made for people who love metrics. With premium, you get velocity, power, tempo, rep speed, form feedback, and automatic exercise detection. Premium is $29.99 yearly! 

Features:
* Automatically recognize the exercise and count reps (not sure how accurate)
* Social aspect with other app users -> post stuff
* easy interface for designing a workout routite + can make an exercise timed instead of by reps
* workout challenges with friends





**Verdict** The smart features are really cool, but not worth a subscription and the interface actually isn't that good. Workout entry isn't that great. They have a potentially amazing app, UI needs some work before I use it and I don't want the subscription. 

As a bonus, I opened up Facebook and messaged them "hi" and then I realived I actually messaged the company. If it matters at all, they got back to me within 5 minutes and it was past 11 PM. 


#### [Strong](http://strongapp.io):

I thought this would be one of my top contenders when looking at apps to use. It has all the features you would expect, graphs, timers, customizeable workouts, an Apple watch app, and a clean interface which is one of my favorite parts. I found that the app is not quite as easy to use as Heavy Set, but is more feature rich. 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://rollonbears234.github.io/images/app_photos/workout/strong/post_workout.jpg" width="300"></div>

I loved the experience of creating my own exercise. I can specify duration, which is good for cardio, bodyweight, and other similar options. They have data you can view for every workout, even for custom exercises. 

Notable features:
* easy to use rest timer if you want to use it (not automatic, but it can be set to automatic)
* a plate calculator built into the rep input
* each evercise has a notes section and even pinned notes for everytime you workout
* Progress pics
* CSV support, this is a must for me if I want to analyze it externally

Unlimited workouts ($4.99)
All features ($6.99) 
- unlimited workouts
- body measurements
- pro keyboard
- warm up calculator
- flags for warm up and dropped sets
- pin charts to dashboard
- apple watch app


Note: the free version is unusable, it tracks max 4 workouts, then you have to delete the previous ones. 



#### [Fitness Point](https://www.fitnesspointapp.com/en/pro):

I didn't like this app at all. Didn't even try it in a workout, I just didn't like the interface. 

#### [Heavy Set](http://www.runloop.com/heavyset):

Wow, what a surprise this was to use. I was using and and just thinking to myself, damn I must be doing something wrong, because this is too easy. 

The import feature is a nice touch, they mention a number of apps that they can import from given you have the CSV file from that site. 

Features:
* If you take a screenshot, it detects it and automatically asks if you want to share it. 
* nice timer to automatically include rest in your workouts
* Dead simple exercise/weight input which is really nice when doing a workout and minimizing time on your phone
* nice data export and import


<div style="text-align:center">

</div>	

	
Overall however, this app isn't smooth in many ways. For example, when creating a new exercise, there isn't an "add" button or "create", you just go back and have to find it to add it. This doesn't make sense. 

**verdict** nice workout experience which is a plus, but overall usability was difficult. Similar problems to stacked with lots of text and jumping around to different screens a lot which gives me a headache.  There is room to grow, but they are doing many things right. 


#### [Lift Log](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id1078162186?mt=8):

Like the name implies, this app is just a log of exercises. They aren't delineated by workouts or training programs. You simply either add a set or exercise and it logs your progress on a timeline. If you want the simplest app that performs one feature only, but does it in a nice way, then this could be your app. 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://rollonbears234.github.io/images/app_photos/workout/lift_log/home.PNG" width="300"></div>



#### [Fitbod](http://fitbod.me):

This app is actually quite delightful to use. When you start a workout, it asks you to do one of the following:
1. Generate your next workout
2. Target individual muscle groups
3. Pick a starting exercise
4. Create a workout from scratch

Another cool featues is the workout map of the body. As I workout, it displays on a body which muscles I have been working on. This app sounds perfect, but they really haven't figured out a lot of the easy steps of actually using it during a workout. There were too many clicks to get to things and you can't create an exercise as you workout. 

The best feature of this app is generating workouts based on recovery. They know what I worked on last and generate workouts to target fresh muscles. However, they don;t have an easy way to add exercises and their premium model is dope with lots of workout customizations, but their pricing is a subscription model. **Yearly for $40! - Not worth it**

#### [Iron Pro](https://ironpro.net):

Beginning of the workout gives these options:
1. Plan a new workout
2. Existing programs/templates (you create templates, programs are premade)
3. Workout generator
4. Workout and add exercises as you go. 

I really like these options to start out with because it gives me options for how I want to start my workout. Maybe I am inspired to create my own workout for the day, or I just want to improv like I normally do. They also have a body map showing where you worked out that week. Might be useful to try and make it all colored every week. 

The actual workout interface with this app is awesome. I loved how the sets and reps were displayed and how easy it was to move onto the next set. 

I didn't like the workout stats, it isn't very detailed, and the exercises aren't listed in a convenient place. You can only add them during a workout or hidden in settings. I get that they don't want the app to be too cluttered. Right now the app is quite simple, you open the app and start a workout. 

Iron Pro also has lots of in app purchasesL Audio control mode, apple watch, workout generator, and more programs. All for $11.99. Might be a good app. 

**Verdict** A nice looking app, but a little pricey and not as metrics driven as I would like. 

#### [Gravitus](http://gravitus.co/?ref=producthunt): - An app for lyfters

This app is nice for a couple reasongs. Its has a wide variety of exercies to pick from because of its community. You post workouts to the community and it crowd sources the exercises people creates to give you a wide variety of options. It just makes sense to use other users to help share exercises to help me when I search to add an exercise to my workout. 

Gravitus also has workout templates and more social features than other apps. 

**Verdict** This app didn't win me over because I found adding exercises kinda cumbersome compared to other apps and input took a lot longer. 

## My Pick

**Strong**

I don't know how they did it, but the creators packed a ton of features into an app, but the experiences are nice and easy to use. I love having tons of features, but the app still feels simple to use. For functionality and usability, this is the best app I checked out.

#### **Appendix**

[Link to all photos](https://goo.gl/photos/yH1SPkmKntKarunK9)

I recently realized how amazing the health possibilities of fitness tracking apps are. Pretty soon all our metrics will go into creating better workouts and for resting when needing to heal torn muscles. It would also let us reduce all the touchpoints to recording our workouts and it will all be automatically measured. Also, there are apps for slo mo camera, tennis, golf, swimming, and even walking. 


Other Apps I didn't have time to test (maybe they are good). I choose the ones above based on exploring the app store and searching "Best Workout Trackers" online. I list these because there may be something out there that works better for you and I want to at least present to you all the possible options here. Bellow I also just listed some other workout styles. There are some 5x5 apps, workout of the day, communities, and others.
