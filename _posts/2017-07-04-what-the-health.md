### What the Health

<img src="https://rollonbears234.github.io/images/misc_photos/what_the_health.png" width="300">

Earlier this year, I watched the Documentary, *Food Inc*, and was amazed at how the American food system has so many problems leading to poor health in order to profit. *What the Health* offered a more detailed dive into our food system, focused on diets. I was blown away with the link between poor eating and diseases in this country. 

The finding boil down into a couple key detials:
1. America focuses on diognosing and then perscribing pills. There is an argument to be made that pharmacuitical companies shove pills at doctors to encourage them as the best solution to disease. 
2. Doctors are not trained on nutrition, they do not have a prevention mindset, only pills and antibiotics. 
3. The American Diabeties Association, the Heart Association, Susan B Komen, and many other organizations supposed to be fighting for our health are supported by the dairy and meat industries, the very organizations hurthing our health. This is like Tabacco companies sponsoring the Lung Cancer Association. 

I want to check the research further and have not switched to vegan yet. They made claims equating eggs to 5 cigarretes per day and they downplayed the role of sugar in unhealthy diets.
